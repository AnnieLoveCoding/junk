Instructions:

- Thanks for your interest in NetSuite development!  Please complete the
  following questions.  If you can't solve a problem completely, feel free to
  submit your best partial solution, together with a comment as to what is
  missing or what shortcomings you see with your solution.  We give partial
  credit!

- For SQL questions, you may use any dialect of SQL.  Preferred dialects are
  ANSI SQL and Oracle SQL.  You may wish to indicate the dialect you are using.

- For programming questions, Java is the preferred language.  However, you may
  also use another modern object-oriented language such as C++, Python, Ruby,
  JavaScript, C#, or Objective C, or a functional language such as Scheme,
  Haskell, Erlang, Scala, or OCaml.  Just let us know what you're doing.

- We'll be looking at everything.  Pretend you are writing production code.
  We'll take into account comments (if any), identifier names, and formatting.

- Good luck!                                                                1.32

QUESTION 1

Given a sorted array of integers, write a method to remove the duplicates.  Do
not use any classes from the java.util package, or the equivalent library for
your language.

Example: [ 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 10, 13, 15, 15, 17 ] ->
         [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 13, 15, 17 ]

A) Solution template:

    int[] removeDuplicates(int[] values)
    {
        // your code here
    }

   Questions (answer these):
   1. Did you write that as if you were writing production code?
   2. What assumptions does your implementation make about the input parameter?
   3. What is removeDuplicates(x).length, in your implementation?
   4. Are you using all the information you have about the input array?
   5. What is the algorithmic complexity ("big O") of your function?

B) Now implement your solution to A as a Java iterator that does not modify the source
   array, and returns only unique elements.  Write a concrete subclass of the
   interface java.util.Iterator; the interface is included below for convenience
   (see http://download-llnw.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/Iterator.html).
   You do not need to implement the optional remove() method.

   (For other languages, implement a generator or other equivalent construct.)

   Do not "cheat" by calling the removeDuplicates() you defined above. One benefit
   of iterators is that they can operate incrementally -- make your iterator
   only do the minimum work it needs to in each call to hasNext() or next().

    public interface Iterator<E>
    {
        /** Returns true if the iteration has more elements. */
        boolean hasNext();

        /** Returns the next element in the iteration. */
        E next();

        /** Removes from the underlying collection the last element returned by
            the iterator (optional operation). */
        void remove();
    }

   Questions (answer these):
   6. Does your implementation work for generic objects, numbers, or integers?
   7. If it does not work with objects, what would be required to make it work
      for generic objects?

QUESTION 2

Given a non-negative real number a, its square root is a number x, such that x * x = a.
One way to compute a square root is via successive approximation, where one estimate
yields a better estimate.

For example, let's say you are trying to find the square root of 2, and you have
an estimate of 1.5. We'll say a = 2, and x = 1.5. To compute a better estimate,
we'll divide a by x. This gives a new value y = 1.333333... However, we can't just
take this as our next estimate (why not?). We need to average it with the previous
estimate. So our next estimate, xx will be (x + y) / 2, or 1.416666...

A) Write a function that takes a non-negative real number a, and an epsilon (a
   small real number), and returns an approximation of the square root of a.

    double square_root(double a, double epsilon) ...

   Epsilon determines how accurate the approximation needs to be. The function
   should return the first approximation x it obtains that satisfies abs(x*x - a) < epsilon,
   where abs(x) is the absolute value of x.

   Questions (answer these):
   1. Why can't the next estimate, xx, be computed as a / x, where x is the
      previous estimate?
   2. What happens, in your implementation, if a = 0?
   3. What value does your program give for square_root(2, 1e-6)?

QUESTION 3

You are given two database tables, EMPLOYEES and BONUS, with the following
schema.  Data shown below should be considered example data; the actual table
will contain other data.

   EMPLOYEES                                       BONUS
   __________________________________________      _____________
   EMPID  NAME  SUPERVISOR  LOCATION   SALARY      EMPID  NBONUS
   ------------------------------------------      -------------
      34  Amy               NY         110000         17    5000
      17  Ben           34  TN          75000         10    2000
       5  Chris         34  TN          80000         34    5000
      10  Don            5  HI         100000      ...
   ...

A) Write a SQL statement to return the employee's name, supervisor's name and
   bonus of everyone who got a bonus greater than 1000.

B) Write a SQL statement to list the highest paid employee in each location.
   Ranking should be based on salary plus bonus.  Output should include employee
   name, salary, bonus, and total pay (salary plus bonus).

C) Given a NEW_SUPERVISOR table (columns: EMPID, SUPERVISOR), write an update
   statement that updates the supervisor of each employee with a new supervisor.
   The NEW_SUPERVISOR table is an incremental update, so employees not listed in
   the table must retain their existing supervisor.
